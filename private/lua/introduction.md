#Introduction

All our software tagged as V5 ship with a Lua scripting language that expose
new classes and libraries that allow users to extend the existing features or
create new one.

If you are new with the Lua scripting language, the
[Lua documentation](https://www.lua.org/docs.html) and the examples inside this
Knowledge Base are the perfect start.

To write the code you can use the built-in editor or use any text editor of your
choice.

!!! warning
	Encoding errors might happen on some systems.
	Select **UTF-8** encoding in your favorite IDE.

!!! note
	You should keep most of your scripts functions and variables as local to
	avoid collision with other scripts. Global variables should only be used
	to write libraries or scripts that interacts with each other.
